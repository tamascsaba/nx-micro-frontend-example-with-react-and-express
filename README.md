## :books: Code structure

* API Data: The backend service stores data (like users or employees), and can return them on request.
* API Filter: The backend of this service can provide filters for the data API
* Frontend Data: The front-end of this service is responsible for displaying all information regarding the data. Selection criteria will be communicated from another service.
* Frontend Filter: Provides a select to load and present the data
* Shell: This is the host service which contains the Data and Filter frontends
* Employee library: Contains most of the employee related frontend logic
* Shares libraries: Common components, stores and interfaces
